You begin to tickle the marshmallow and the marshmallow begins to laugh.
You continue tickling and the marshmallow laughs harder and everything begins to shake.
Suddenly, all the marshmallow explodes and you are covered in gooey goodness.
You look around to make sure no one's watching and begin licking yourself.
